                <div>Women Safety system with GPS Tracking & Alerts canbe subdivided into two
                    sections such as Transmitter and Receiver section. The circuit diagrams for
                    each section is described as follows:</div>
                <div>Transmitter Section: In the RF Transmitter part, there will be an SOS
                    button along with a 433 MHz RF transmitter, which will transmit the datato
                    the receiver part wirelessly. The purpose of making two individual parts
                    here is, to minimize the size of the transmitting module so that it can be
                    worn as a wrist band. The circuit diagram for the transmitter part is shown
                    below:</div>
                <div class="img-div">
                    <img src="./images/8.png" alt="intro-img" class="div-img">
                </div>
                <div>Receiver Section: In the RF Receiver section, the data transmitted from
                    the wrist band (Transmitter part) is received by the device having a 433
                    MHz RF receiver. The RF receiver sends this information to Arduino
                    through the digital pin. Arduino Nano then receives the signal and
                    processes it using the program which is flashed into it. When the victim
                    presses the SOS button in the transmitter part, a HIGH signal isgenerated
                    and passes tothe Arduino side, and then Arduino sends a signal to
                    SIM900 modem, to send an SMS to Registered user along with the GPS
                    coordinate which has already been stored in the Microcontroller by the
                    help of NEO6M GPS module. The circuit diagram of the Receiver side is
                    shown as below:</div>
