                    <li>Women safety is a very important issue due torising crimes against women these days. To help resolve this issue we propose a gps based women safety system.</li>
                    <li>This system can be turned on by a woman in case she even thinks she would be in trouble</li>
                    <li>Once the button is pressed, system now sends her
                        location to the authorized personnel number through
                        SMSmessage as a security measure and also sounds
                        a buzzer continuously so that nearby people may
                        realize the situation.</li>
                    <li>This device will prove to be very useful in savinglives
                        as well as preventing atrocities againstwomen.</li>
                    <li>The device uses GPS sensor along with a gsm modem, LCD display, leds and
                        microcontroller based circuit to achieve this system.</li>
                    <li>We intend to create a partial wearable that can provide a complete securitysolution
                        and become a utility that eases the apprehension among women and their family
                        members.</li>
                    <li>The objective is to create a safety system in the form of aportable safety device for
                        women, that does the following task :Alerts family and police and gives location
                        coordinates of the woman being attacked.</li>
